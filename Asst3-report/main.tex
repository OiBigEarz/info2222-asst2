\end{figure}

\section{Design-Evaluate – Low Fidelity or High Fidelity Prototype }
\subsection*{Design Process}
Based on the information architecture derived from the card sorting exercise, we brainstormed and developed initial sketches, which were then translated into digital wireframes. The design focused on simplicity and ease of navigation, aligning with user expectations and feedback.

\subsection*{Prototype Description}
The prototype was developed using miro, featuring the following key sections:

- \textbf{Home Dashboard}: Quick access different chats with friends, quick navigation with articles and posts.

- \textbf{Messages}: Detailed views for private and lobby chats.

- \textbf{Knowledge Repository}: A section for article browsing and interaction.

- \textbf{Assignments}: A section for easily accessible information for assignments.

\end{itemize}


\section{Design-Evaluate (Initial Implementation of Prototype}

\subsection*{Development Approach and Plan}
We utilized GitHub to track changes to our codebase, which can be reviewed at \href{https://github.com/OiBigEarz/info2222-asst2}{our project repository}. https://github.com/OiBigEarz/info2222-asst2. 

\textbf{Iteration Plan:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Iteration \#1 (Weeks 9-10):} Initially, we focused on the basic functionalities, including messaging capabilities, friend management, and laying the groundwork for the UI/UX for future articles. User testing after this iteration provided positive feedback regarding the simplicity of the layout but also pointed out the absence of several expected features such as display of the current username and more intuitive navigation aids.
    \item \textbf{Iteration \#2 (Weeks 11-12):} In response to feedback, the second iteration prioritized the implementation of core functionalities like article management and enhancements in account type functionalities. This phase aimed to refine the user experience and integrate essential features highlighted during the initial user feedback.
