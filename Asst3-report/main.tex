\end{figure}

\section{Design-Evaluate â€“ Low Fidelity or High Fidelity Prototype }
\subsection*{Design Process}
Based on the information architecture derived from the card sorting exercise, we brainstormed and developed initial sketches, which were then translated into digital wireframes. The design focused on simplicity and ease of navigation, aligning with user expectations and feedback.

\subsection*{Prototype Description}
The prototype was developed using miro, featuring the following key sections:

- \textbf{Home Dashboard}: Quick access different chats with friends, quick navigation with articles and posts.

- \textbf{Messages}: Detailed views for private and lobby chats.

- \textbf{Knowledge Repository}: A section for article browsing and interaction.

- \textbf{Assignments}: A section for easily accessible information for assignments.
